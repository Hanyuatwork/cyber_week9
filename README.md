# Honepots Deployed
I deployed the honeypot using the MHN application in google cloud.

# Any issues you encountered
I followed the instruction in codepath, it takes time to set everything up. The only problem I got is when it creating the firewall, it takes forever. I figure it out that I need to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic on google cloud.
